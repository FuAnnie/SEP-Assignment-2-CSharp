-- Arrays and Strings

1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C#?
    As the StringBuilder object is mutable, it provides better performance as compared to the String object when heavy string manipulations are involved.
    Use String when dealing with few or no modifications to the string, such as storing a constant string. 
    Use StringBuilder when needing to perform multiple string manipulations or concatenations. 
    
2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
    Array
    
3. How do you sort an array in C#?
    Array.Sort()
    
4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in an array?

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
    No, arrays are strongly typed. 
    
6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
    CopyTo() is for copying the contents of one array into another array, requiring the destination array to be predefined. 
    Clone() is for creating a new array that is a copy of the original array.
